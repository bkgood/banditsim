# banditsim
Multi-armed bandit simulator

Currently incomplete, will eventually (soon) power a bit of a writeup with
comparative simulations including the original (to my knowledge) bandit
solution within (see src/lwprsolver.py).

GPLv2 (only v2, not eg. v3) for now; might relicense if I feel like it or
demand arises. All files copyright 2015 William Good unless otherwise noted.
